Meticulously crafted collection of NixOS configurations tailored for my systems. This repository encapsulates a unified setup across different machines, ensuring a consistent and efficient environment no matter where I‚Äôm working. The configurations are designed with modularity and clarity in mind, making it easy to adapt and scale. Whether it's setting up a new machine or refining an existing setup, Symphony brings what I believe to be the best practices in NixOS configuration management, unified under a single, cohesive structure. System and home manager configurations are kept separate to keep configuration flexible and modular.
